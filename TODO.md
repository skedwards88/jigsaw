# TODO

- let user control background color (make sure any text is still visible and the scroll bar and borders are still visible)
- handle non-square images
- add functionality to buttons
- allow to set num pieces
- allow to choose image
- save puzzle progress


what's next:

- when drop, account for offset from center so that piece doesn't jump
- figure out how to drag a board group as a group. maybe the x/y should apply to the group as a whole?

- figure out how to tell that pieces should be connected

- rotation of pieces
- better piece shape
- can I make the original image disappear while dragging?
- make the drag image match the size of the pieces on the board
